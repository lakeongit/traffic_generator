Certainly! Here's a sample README file with detailed instructions on how to run the code on an EC2 instance:

# AI-Aided Cybersecurity Lab

This repository contains code for the AI-Aided Cybersecurity Lab, specifically for generating a synthetic dataset and running anomaly detection on an EC2 instance.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account: You will need an AWS account to create and manage an EC2 instance.
- EC2 Instance: Launch an EC2 instance with the desired specifications and note down the instance details (e.g., instance ID, security group, key pair).

## Setup

1. Launch an EC2 Instance:
   - Log in to your AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to EC2 service.
   - Launch a new instance using your preferred AMI (Amazon Machine Image) and instance type.
   - Configure the security group to allow inbound SSH (port 22) and any other necessary traffic.
   - Create or use an existing key pair to connect to the instance.

2. Connect to the EC2 Instance:
   - Open a terminal or SSH client on your local machine.
   - Use the following command to connect to the instance, replacing `<key_pair>` and `<public_dns>` with your specific values:

     ```shell
     ssh -i <key_pair>.pem ec2-user@<public_dns>
     ```

3. Clone the Repository:
   - Once connected to the EC2 instance, clone this repository using the following command:

     ```shell
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-cybersecurity-lab.git
     ```

4. Generate the Dataset:
   - Navigate to the project directory:

     ```shell
     cd ai-cybersecurity-lab
     ```

   - Run the Python script to generate the dataset:

     ```shell
     python generate_dataset.py
     ```

   - This will generate a file named `cybersecurity_dataset.csv` in the project directory.

## Usage

- The dataset generation script has been executed, and you now have the `cybersecurity_dataset.csv` file in the project directory. You can use this file as input for your AI-aided cybersecurity lab.

- Implement the anomaly detection algorithm of your choice using the dataset.

## Cleanup

- To clean up the resources and terminate the EC2 instance, follow these steps:
  - Log in to your AWS Management Console.
  - Navigate to the EC2 service.
  - Select the instance that was launched for this lab.
  - Click on "Actions" and choose "Terminate Instance".
  - Confirm the termination when prompted.

Please note that the instructions provided here are high-level and may require further customization based on your specific AWS setup and requirements.

Remember to adhere to AWS best practices, such as securing your EC2 instance, managing access, and monitoring resource usage.
